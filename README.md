## Getting Started

Info about the Java I'm running:

- openjdk version "21.0.5" 2024-10-15 LTS
- OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-21.0.5+11 (build 21.0.5+11-LTS)
- OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-21.0.5+11 (build 21.0.5+11-LTS)

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
